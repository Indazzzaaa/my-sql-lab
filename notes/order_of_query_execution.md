### **SQL Query Execution Order: How Things Work**

Yes! You got the right idea. The **correct execution order** of SQL operations is:

1️⃣ **`FROM` & `JOIN`** → Combine tables first.

2️⃣ **`WHERE`** → Filter rows before grouping.

3️⃣ **`GROUP BY`** → Group the filtered data.

4️⃣ **Aggregate Functions (`SUM()`, `COUNT()`, etc.)** → Apply to each group.

5️⃣ **`HAVING`** → Filter groups based on aggregate results.

6️⃣ **`SELECT`** → Retrieve final columns (including aggregates).

7️⃣ **`ORDER BY`** → Sort results.

8️⃣ **`LIMIT`** → Restrict number of rows.
